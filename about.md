I studied physics, both master and PhD. Then I took a postdoc position at
ETH Zurich to work on the analysis of large datasets of DNA sequences. I keep
analysing DNA sequences for diagnostic purposes at the University of Zurich.

In 2014, with a few colleagues, I founded [enGene Statistics](http://www.engene.ch),
a company offering consulting in data analytics, with a focus on
bioinformatics/genomics.

Here I blog about data and data science in general.
